RAG Chatbot for Stock Analysis

This project is an intelligent chatbot that provides stock-related insights using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It retrieves relevant financial documents, processes them, and generates clear, context-aware responses to user queries.

✨ Features

RAG architecture for accurate, grounded answers

Embedding-based document search

Summaries of company reports, news, and stock information

Interactive chatbot interface

Extensible design for adding new data sources

🧠 Tech Stack

Python

LangChain / LlamaIndex (depending on your implementation)

Vector database (FAISS / ChromaDB)

LLM backend (OpenAI, Llama, or others)

🚀 How It Works

Stock-related documents are collected and converted into chunks

Chunks are embedded and stored in a vector database

When the user asks a question, relevant chunks are retrieved

The LLM generates a final answer grounded in retrieved context

📌 Use Cases

Company financial summary

Stock performance insights

Sector/market overview

Q&A on uploaded or pre-indexed documents
